Analyze the sales data to calculate the delta in RollingQuarter and MAT between November and December for each customer. Use these deltas to categorize customers into the following groups as per the changes observed:

1. 'Bad long-term trend continues' for customers who have a Negative change in both Delta RollingQuarter and Delta MAT.
2. 'Bad long-term trend reversal start' for customers who show a Positive change in Delta RollingQuarter but still a Negative change in Delta MAT.
3. 'Bad long-term trend reversal' for customers who show a Positive change in both Delta RollingQuarter and Delta MAT.

Present the findings in a report that lists only the customers falling into these categories. The report should include:

- The customer's name.
- The calculated Delta RollingQuarter.
- The calculated Delta MAT.
- The category each customer falls into based on their deltas.

Exclude all customers who do not fall into any of these categories to ensure the report is concise and focused on the customers of interest as per the specified criteria.










Analyze the sales data for each customer with a focus on the following metrics: sales_dec2023, PreviousYearChange, RollingQuarterChange, YTDChange, MATCHange, and PreviousMonthChange. Identify customers with considerable shifts between November and December 2023 and provide insights only for those with the most significant changes as per these conditions:

1. An increase or decrease in `PreviousMonthChange` by more than 50%.
2. A `MATCHange` of greater than 30% in either direction, which could indicate a significant trend.
3. A `YTDChange` or `PreviousYearChange` of more than 30%, reflecting major shifts over a longer period.
4. Customers with a `RollingQuarterChange` greater than 20% suggesting notable quarterly performance.

For each customer meeting any of the above criteria, articulate a precise insight that includes:

- A comparison of their sales performance changes between November and December 2023.
- Contextual factors from the data that may contribute to understanding these changes.
- Label the insight with "Critical Alert" for negative trends or "Positive Highlight" for significant improvements.

Construct a report of approximately 500 words, delivering insights for only those customers whose changes are most substantial, excluding customers with marginal or nominal fluctuations.









Analyze the provided sales data with columns: emp_name, customernameh2, sales_dec2023, previous_month_change, PreviousYearChange, RollingQuarter, RollingQuarterPreviousYearChange, YTD, YTDChangeP, MAT, MATChangeP. Construct a 500-word report detailing:

1. A ranked summary of each employee's sales performance, focusing on changes observed in previous_month_change, YTD, and MATChangeP, specifically highlighting any significant shifts or anomalies.
2. A trend analysis of sales_dec2023 against previous_month_change, illustrating any patterns, and comparing these trends to the PreviousYearChange and RollingQuarter metrics.
3. A review of customer sales performance, indicating which customers have shown the most significant changes in sales_dec2023 and previous_month_change, along with a discussion on the stability or volatility in their purchasing patterns.
4. An exploration of the data to reveal any potential correlations between RollingQuarter and RollingQuarterPreviousYearChange across different customer segments.
Please ensure that the report includes factual insights derived from the data, emphasizing notable findings, and refrains from making unfounded predictions or recommendations.

Prepare a 500-word report that provides:

1. An in-depth review of the employee's sales figures, particularly focusing on sales_dec2023 and previous_month_change, highlighting any major increases or decreases.
2. A comparative analysis of the employee's current YTD sales figures with the previous year's performance, using PreviousYearChange as a key indicator.
3. An assessment of the monthly and quarterly sales progression for the employee's customer portfolio, utilizing the RollingQuarter and previous_month_change to identify any trends.
4. An overview of the long-term sales pattern reflected by MAT and MATChangeP, discussing consistency and identifying any outlier months or quarters.

Title: How Hepatitis E and HPV Can Affect Life - Understand and Prevent

Introduction:
In this summary of the YouTube video, we will cover two distinct medical issues - Hepatitis E and the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Hepatitis E is a liver inflammation caused by ingesting contaminated meat and water, while HPV, a sexually transmitted infection, can cause cervical cancer. Both diseases involve mechanisms for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Main Points:
- Hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, a disease transferred from animals to humans. Acute symptoms can include jaundice, diarrhea, and vomiting. People with weakened immune systems can have chronic illness.
- Preventing Hepatitis E involves cooking meats for a minimum of 20 minutes at temperatures exceeding 71 degrees and maintaining good hygiene.
- It is advised that young women have regular cervical cancer screenings (Pap Test) from the age of 21 onwards. If results are normal, the test is only necessary every three years.
- In addition to the Pap smear, there is a HPV-PCR test, which can detect the presence of HPV viruses in the sample. However, this test is not yet covered by health insurance in Switzerland.
- An HPV vaccine is recommended before a person becomes sexually active. In Switzerland, the costs for the vaccine are fully covered between the ages of 11 and 26.

Conclusion: 
While Hepatitis E and HPV pose different health problems, prevention and early detection play crucial roles for both diseases. Suitable treatments contribute to improving the quality of life of affected individuals. People who demonstrate risk factors or live in areas with high infection risk should be aware of these available preventive measures and treatment options.
























The video discusses the case of Bernhard Runker, who developed severe pain due to Hepatitis E, a liver inflammation transmitted from animals to humans, diagnosed at the University Clinic in Basel. Key points include the transmission of Hepatitis E through contaminated water and undercooked meat, Bernhard's treatment involving medications and therapy leading to recovery, and preventive measures like proper food handling and hygiene to avoid the virus. Despite Hepatitis E being rare in Switzerland, awareness and prompt medical intervention for symptoms are emphasized.


Introduction: 
This video is about Bernhard Runker, who began to struggle with severe pain in his shoulders, chest, arms, and hands five years ago. Tests at the University Clinic in Basel led to a diagnosis of Hepatitis E, a form of hepatitis that is transmitted from animals to humans. 

Main Ideas:

- Hepatitis E is a form of hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver, which is transmitted from animals to humans. It is different from other types of hepatitis in this regard.
- Most people with Hepatitis E notice nothing, while some, like Bernhard, suffer from severe pain and discomfort.
- Hepatitis E can be transmitted through contaminated water and meat products. It is particularly important to thoroughly cook meat in order to inactivate the virus.
- Bernhard received strong medications and cortisone for the pain. He also began physio and occupational therapy to stimulate the nerves in the affected body parts.
- After several months of treatment, the feeling returned to his fingers and he was able to use his hand normally again.
- It is still unclear how Bernhard contracted the virus. To avoid a recurrence, he is now very careful about what he eats.

Conclusion:
Although Hepatitis E is not very common in Switzerland, it's important to know how the virus is transmitted in order to protect oneself. This includes thoroughly cooking meat and practicing proper hygiene. Individuals who experience severe pain or other symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.
